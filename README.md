# SB_Capstone_Project_1
This is the iPython notebook code for my first SpringBoard Capstone Project. For a version of this without code (and with more formatting), see https://wamiller0783.github.io/Amazon-reviews-less-helpful.html.

Methods used include EDA, statistical inference using linear regression, and unsupervised topic modeling using LDA.
